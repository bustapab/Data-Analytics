# Waze Project

This project was done as final milestones for each of the six courses in Google's Advanced Data Analytics Certificate Program

The course used executive summaries to communicate project findings/next steps.

The code, analysis, visualizations and modeling are included in five jupiter notebooks.  Each course builds on the prior one.
