This is the capstone project from Google's Advanced Data Analytics Certificate Program.

In this project, I imported the project data and required libraries.  Then performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) leveraging visualization.  In paralell, I completed data cleaning/preparation.

I then built and evaluated random forest classification and XGBoost classification models, considering recall as the key evaluatio metric.  The random forest model was selected as the best one.  

The model overall prediction capability is excellent with 92% recall for employees that left.
